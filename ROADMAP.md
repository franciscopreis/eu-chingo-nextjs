# 🧭 What's Next for Eu-Chingo

Where I'm taking this I Ching (Next) app next (ba dum ss 🥁📀), or features I'm excited to build and improvements I want to make (if I had all the time in the world)

---

## ✅ **What's (hopefully) Working**

_What I've done_

- **Full I Ching experience**: Traditional coin method divination
- **Reading history**: Save, review, and add notes to past readings
- **Clean, responsive interface**: Works great on phone and desktop (I think)
- **Live and production-ready**: Used by real people every day (AKA I make my friends use it)

---

## 🔨 **Currently (ahm ahm) Building**

_What I **should** be coding right now_

- [ ] **More divination methods**: Yarrow Stalk and Modified Coin (maybe I'll do only one, the probabilities are the same for both methods)
- [ ] **Manual hexagram input**: Let people do their own readings and just check the hexagrams on the website (this what I Ching is all about)
- [ ] **Performance tweaks**: Making everything faster and smoother (without breaking anything, please)
- [ ] **Code cleanup**: Better organization under the hood (yeah, let's change the architecture one more time)

---

## 📅 **Coming """"Soon""""**

_Next on my list_

- [ ] **Reading insights**: Spot patterns in your divination history (it's all about the community, man)
- [ ] **Share readings**: Private links to share with friends (so I can spam my friends)
- [ ] **Export your data**: Download readings as PDF or JSON
- [ ] **Portuguese translations**: After all this project is about making I Ching more accessible for Portuguese speakers
- [ ] **Admin tools**: For managing content and translations (AKA making my life easier)

---

## 💭 **Future Possibilities**

_Ideas I dreamed about_

- **Community features**: Discuss interpretations, and even translations, with others
- **Reading reminders**: Email follow-ups on significant readings to help people evaluate their past readings
- **Premium content and professional readings**: Advanced I Ching materials and personalized interpretation (maybe I can make some money from this 💰)
- **Global insights**: See patterns across all users' readings (I think I could make something fun out of this)

---

## 🔧 **Technical Polish**

_Making it better behind the scenes_

- [ ] **Better error handling**: More helpful when things go wrong
- [ ] **Database optimization**: Faster queries, smarter caching, and more commentary sections from I Ching
- [ ] **Accessibility improvements**: Works better for everyone
